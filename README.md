## ⚡ Overview

[Radian](https://radianos.com) is an open-source React component library built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

**Radian Resources** (`radian-resources`) is a dedicated public repository for hosting and serving Radian's static design assets—such as user avatars, brand logos, country flags, and file-type icons. 

By leveraging the free, global **jsDelivr CDN**, developers can hotlink these assets directly in their production applications with zero bandwidth costs and ultra-low latency.

---

## 🚀 How It Works (CDN Hotlinking)

You do **not** need to clone this repository or install npm packages to use these assets. All assets are hotlinkable directly from your application using the following base CDN URL format:

```text
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Radian-os/radian-resources@main/packages/{package-name}/src/{file}
```

- **`{package-name}`**: The subfolder name under `packages/` (e.g., `avatars`, `brand-logos`).
- **`{file}`**: The filename of the asset (e.g., `1.png`, `radian.svg`).
